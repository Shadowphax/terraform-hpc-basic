## Goal

The goal is to provide researchers with a zero-touch provisioned HPC cluster and parallel BeeGFS storage attached. The environment scales both slurm worker nodes and BeeGFS storage nodes without any downtime required. The deployment is not limited to the iLifu Cloud but is limited to only run on OpenStack environments.</br>
</br>
The intended use-case is for researchers who require short-term compute capacity and storage capabilities to quickly deploy a cluster on the iLifu OpenStack Research Cloud. </br>

## Items which need completion

[x] Terraform all the nodes </br>
[x] Ansible provisioner for Terraform</br>
[x] Dynamic Ansible inventory</br>
[x] BeeGFS Storage</br>
[ ] Slurm Ansible Role</br>
[ ] InfluxDB, TeleGraph, PrometheusIO, Grafana (Docker?)</br>
[ ] MinIO S3 storage (Might wanna use BeeGFS storage nodes with seperate volumes)</br>
[ ] Get rid of the "sleep wait for servers to settle " Need a way to detect that all servers are available via ssh and continue deployment</br>

## Nota Bene

This is a completely separate enviroment and has no bearing on the existing BeeGFS storage attached to the iLifu Cloud. </br>
</br>
There are few caveats which I will work on when I have a moment. They include the following: </br>
* Ubuntu 18.04 only. Other OS distributions will be considered.
* BeeGFS block storage allocation per server. Refer to ```main.tf```. 
* Stack monitoring with InfluxDB and Telegraph. 

## Requirements

[Terraform v0.12](https://terraform.io)</br>
[Ansible Engine v2.8](https://ansible.com)


## Infrastructure Deployed
 - Bastion node (Headnode)
 - Slurm Controller
 - Slurm Worker Nodes
 - BeeGFS Storage


## Usage

1. Clone the respository </br>
`git clone https://github.com/Shadowphax/terraform-hpc-basic.git `

2. Create a new workspace for Terraform to create and managed it's state. </br>
`terraform workspace new slurm`</br>

3. Download the relevant Terraform plugins and  template engines. </br>
`terraform init`</br>

4. Download the ansible roles.</br>
`ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml`

5. Execute the `plan` to verify the creation of infrastructure. </br>
`terraform plan -out plan.out`</br>

6. Execute the `apply` to update the infrastructure </br>
`terraform apply plan.out`</br>

## Adding additional Ansible Roles

1. Update the requirements.yml file in order to add ansible roles.
2. Execute `ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml` for installation.</br>
